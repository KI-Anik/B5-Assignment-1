Blog Post 1: Differences Between Interfaces and Types in TypeScript

When building scalable applications with TypeScript, understanding the difference between interface and type is essential. While they serve similar roles—allowing us to define the shape of data—there are key differences:

1. Extending and Implementing

interface is designed for object shapes and is easily extendable.

it can extends multiple interfaces and implement them in classes.
though type can also extend via intersections but isn't always as flexible in class-based OOP.

2. Declaration Merging

Interfaces support declaration merging, meaning you can define them multiple times and TypeScript will merge them.
type cannot be re-declared.

3. Use Cases

Use interface when working with classes and object contracts.

Use type for union types, primitive aliases, and tuples.

In conclusion, both are powerful. Prefer interface for objects and class structures, and use type when you need more advanced type compositions.



Blog Post 2: Understanding keyof in TypeScript

The keyof keyword in TypeScript is a type operator that returns the union of all property names of a given type.

This helps write type-safe generic functions, where we ensure only valid keys of the object are used, reducing runtime bugs and increasing reliability.
